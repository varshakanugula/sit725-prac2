1- html page
2- create a server (server.js)

For Practical 03:

Get the HTML File (page 13)
Make the styles.css
Add the required styles in styles.css

Add the main body in the html file (next slide)
Button will show "Auto_Fix_High", which is a keyword from GoogleFont. Just google 'Google font material icons guide' and use the href style sheet.

Now add more styles in the styles.css

## Now, add the logic of Clickme button in the script.js file. Dollar sign is the jquery line (You can check it further if you want)

Now, let's move on to add 'Cards'
Add another class row for the card 'Kitten'

Let's add card List in scripts.js (Use the given code - just check the spellings of description)
just add <div id = "card-section" class="row"> This will link the card section with that row.

Nowww, Let's add the modal (the final thing for today)
In the alignment add modal "<a class="waves-effect waves-light btn click-me-button modal-trigger" data-target="modal1" id="clickMeButton">
Add the code for modal now.

Add Submit form in script.js
and also add modal configuration

That's it, it was that simple
